In comparison to the street sign recognition task, is the rubiks cube problem 
a well defined one. Because every sign on the street, could have a different form, 
color or written text.

Therefore we have a cube with 6 faces and 9 facelets and each one 
consists of 4 corners, there is no more variety except the color.

We have taken two ways of possible solutions, one is the buttom up and
the other is the top down one.
The top down approach should capture the outer contour of the cube and make
assumptions on the possible inner configuration of each visible face,
while the bottom up approach register each facelet and the model should
make assumptions on the relation between each facelet to get the complete face
or cube.


We have ran already into the following problems, the first one is to
determine the right contours due to the nature of the real world no line
is an exactly straight line without possible interruptions, and no edge is 
really sharp therefore we had to use filters and parameters to be able to
ignore certain irregularities. We had also to define which contours are relevant
and set up a environment with a diffuse light to avoid reflections.

Grouping facelets is an issue which we are trying to solve, because
some facelets do not get recognized and therefore we have to make assumptions
for the missing one. We are intending to combine the bottom up and bottom down
approach to simplify the problem.
